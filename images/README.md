# V-Card

> ["What do you think?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZVkW9p-cCU)

- Create a public repository: `v-card`
- Duration: 1 day

## Learning objectives

- Write meaningful, semantically correct HTML
- Use modern positioning techniques using the `grid` or `flexbox` model
- Create and use a wireframe if needed
- **advanced** Learn to use git branches

## The mission

Let's write a Vcard (virtual card), itâ€™s a small one page serving as a virtual business card. Create a new repository called VCard and use one of the css positioning techniques stated above!

### Want to go the extra mile?

Let's have a first look at git branches ([here is a nice article about it](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches)).

Once your V-Card is finished, let's try to recreate the project with another positioning technique (if you used `flex`, this time use `grid` and vice-versa) on a new branch.

Branch are a safe way to try new features without compromising the code quality of the main one.
